						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>Python is a high-level interpreted programming language. It is a general-purpose language
							and it supports many different programming paradigms, including structured, functional
							and object-oriented programming. It emphasizes on code readability and easiness of code
							development. These are achieved through code indentation and through hiding of low-level
							operations from the programmer. As a result of easiness to learn and use, Python is
							commonly used not only by programmers and people with Computer Science background, but
							by scientists of other disciplines as well. For this reason it consistently ranks in the
							top spots of the list with the most used programming languages.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>History</h3>
						<p>The first version of Python was developed between 1989 and 1991 at Centrum Wiskunde &
							Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands by Guido van Rossum, who continued to be the lead
							developer for the project until 2018. In the year 2000, Python 2.0 was released with the
							new version including major new features such as support for unicode and a more
							sophisticated garbage collector. Another key station in the language's history was in
							2008 when the Python 3.0 was released. This version was a major revision of the language
							and as a result, a lot of source code written in the previous versions couldn't be
							executed in the new one. The latest version of Python as of 25 April 2021 is Python
							3.9.4.</p>

						<h3>Syntactic and semantic features</h3>
						<p>As stated in the introduction, Python was designed to be an easy to understand language.
							Instead of using curly brackets (like other languages such as C or Java) to delimit blocks,
							it uses whitespace indentation. Instead of using punctuation for logical conditions, it uses
							English keywords. Though semicolons after commands are allowed, they are rarely used. In
							contrast to most programming languages, it allows chained comparisons such as
							<code>a &lt;= b &lt;= c</code>. Python also doesn't bind a variable name to a certain type
							of data, which makes it easier for non programmers to use. Of course these are not all the
							syntactic and semantic characteristics of Python but some that distinguish it from other
							popular programming languages.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Uses</h3>
						<p>Python is used in a wide range of activities. It can be used as a scripting language for web
							applications, usually with web frameworks like Django or Flask. Another field where Python
							is widely used is scientific computing with libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy or
							more specialized frameworks such as Biopython or Astropy for domain-specific work. Python is
							also the most widely used language for artificial intelligence and machine learning projects
							with libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch. Some large technology
							organizations who use Python include Wikipedia, Google, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon,
							Instagram, Spotify, Reddit and many more.

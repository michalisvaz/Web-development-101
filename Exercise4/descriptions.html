					<span class="term">High-level</span>
					<span class="definition">A high-level programming language offers a strong abstraction from the details of
						the computer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Ιnterpreted</span>
					<span class="definition">An interpreted programming language is a language such that programs written in it,
						don't need to be compiled to a machine language program in order to be executed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">General-purpose</span>
					<span class="definition">A general-purpose programming language is designed to be used for writing software
						in a wide variety of application domains. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Programming paradigm</span>
					<span class="definition">A programming paradigm is a general way to write code. Programming paradigms are
						used to classify programming languages.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Structured programming</span>
					<span class="definition">Structured programming is a programming paradigm that makes wide use of control
						flow constructs (selection and repetition), block structures and subroutines, aiming to improve code
						quality and development time.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Functional programming</span>
					<span class="definition">Functional programming is the programming paradigm in which programs are mostly
						constructed by applying and composing functions.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Object-oriented programming</span>
					<span class="definition">Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on using
						"objects", which is an entity that encapsulates data and procedures.</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="term">Low-level</span>
					<span class="definition">Low-level when reffering to programming, means something closely related to
						(computer specific) hardware.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Unicode</span>
					<span class="definition">A standard for encoding text. It covers the characters of most existing human
						languages and many special symbols.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Grabage collection</span>
					<span class="definition">Garbage collection in Computer Science is a way of managing memory. Programming
						languages that use a grabage collector save the programmer from having to take care of memory management
						by themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Whitespace indentation</span>
					<span class="definition">This kind of indentation means that there exists an increase in indentation after
						certain statements and a decrease in indentation when a block ends.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Scripting language</span>
					<span class="definition">A scripting language is a programming language that is used (among other other
						things) to automate tasks that would normally be executed one by one by a human. Usually a scripting
						language is also an interpreted one.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Scientific computing</span>
					<span class="definition">Scientific computing (also called Computational Science) is a field that uses
						advanced computing techniques to solve complex problems.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="term">Machine learning</span>
					<span class="definition">Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating
						algorithms that improve automatically through experience and through the use of data.</span>

# Web-development-101

This is the first project for AUEB Informatics' course "Technologies and Programming of Web Applications". Firstly, we had to create a simple HTML-only page with information about ourselves and then to style the page using CSS. Afterwards, we needed to create a new page for a topic we were interested in (I chose Python) and to add styling and functionality to it with CSS and JavaScript (respectively).

Some technologies/concepts I used and familiarized myself with during this project were:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Responsive Design
* Grid Layout
* FlexBox
* Form Validation

**Notes** Even though the first pages have information about me, you shouldn't consider them CV-like information. If you are interested in such information look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalis-vazaios-731473212/)
